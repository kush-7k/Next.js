REACT SERVER COMPONENTS (RSC)
 This architetcture provides a new way of creating react components , by spiltting them into two types
 -> Server components
 -> Client components

 By Default,
  All components are server components
  They can read files or fetch data from database
  They do not have ability to use hooks or hndle user intercations

  Client components
  To create a client components, we need to write "use client" at the top of the component files
  They can use hooks and handle user intercations
