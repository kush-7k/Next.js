REACT SERVER COMPONENTS (RSC)
 This architetcture provides a new way of creating react components , by spiltting them into two types
 -> Server components
 -> Client components

  Server components
  By Default,
  All components are server components
  They can read files or fetch data from database
  They do not have ability to use hooks or hndle user intercations

  Client components
  To create a client components, we need to write "use client" at the top of the component files
  They can use hooks and handle user intercations.

ROUTING
 
  It has file based routing mechanism
  ALl routes must be placed in app folder
  Every file that corresponds to a route must be named as page.js or page.tsx
  Each folder corresponds to path segments in the URL
  There are many stages of routing
   > localhost/home
   > localhost/about, and many mroe
   > localhost/blog/first,second (This is known as nested routes)
   > localhost/products/id  (On going to products, then there can be prod1,2,3 and clicking on each leads to 1,2,3 details)
